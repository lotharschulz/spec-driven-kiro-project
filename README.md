## Spec-Driven Kiro Project

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Test Project**: This is an experimental project testing Kiro IDE's spec-driven development approach. Currently work-in-progress and may be incomplete.

A hands-on exploration of [Kiro IDE's](https://kiro.dev) three-layer spec-driven development methodology:
- Requirements using EARS syntax
- Technical design blueprints  
- Implementation tasks for AI agents

### Background

This project accompanies my review and analysis of Kiro IDE. For the full context, methodology explanation, and lessons learned, read the blog post:
