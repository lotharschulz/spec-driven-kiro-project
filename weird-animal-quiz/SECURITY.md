# Security Guidelines for Weird Animal Quiz

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Weird Animal Quiz application and provides guidelines for maintaining security best practices.

## Security Features

### Input Validation and Sanitization
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- Comprehensive validation for question data, user responses, and state management
- Strict type checking with TypeScript

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Restrictive CSP implemented to prevent XSS and other injection attacks
- Inline scripts and styles are limited and controlled
- External resources are restricted to trusted sources

### HTTPS Enforcement
- HTTPS is enforced in production environments
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers are applied
- Insecure connection attempts are monitored and logged

### Rate Limiting
- User interactions are rate-limited to prevent abuse
- Maximum 10 requests per minute per user
- Configurable rate limiting parameters

### Secure Storage
- Sensitive data is stored in memory only, not in localStorage
- Non-sensitive data uses localStorage with proper prefixing
- Automatic data cleanup on page unload and visibility change

### Security Monitoring
- Security events are logged and monitored
- Suspicious activity detection with automated alerts
- Comprehensive audit trail for security-related events

### Dependency Security
- All dependencies are verified against security criteria
- Regular security audits with npm audit
- Package verification to prevent typosquatting

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**
   - Always validate and sanitize user inputs
   - Use the `InputSanitizer` class for all user-provided data
   - Never trust client-side data without validation

2. **Output Encoding**
   - Use React's built-in XSS protection
   - For dynamic HTML content, use `DOMPurify` or similar libraries
   - Always encode data before displaying it to users

3. **Secure Storage**
   - Use `secureStorage.setLocalStorage()` for non-sensitive data
   - Use `secureStorage.setMemoryOnly()` for sensitive data
   - Clear sensitive data when no longer needed

4. **Error Handling**
   - Use the secure error handling utilities
   - Never expose internal error details to users
   - Log errors securely with `securityMonitor`

5. **Dependency Management**
   - Only add dependencies after security review
   - Run `npm run security:check` before adding new packages
   - Keep dependencies updated with `npm run security:fix`

### For Content Creators

1. **Content Validation**
   - Ensure all quiz content is properly formatted
   - Avoid including executable code in content
   - Follow the content guidelines for appropriate language

2. **Media Assets**
   - Only use approved image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, SVG, WebP)
   - Keep file sizes under 5MB
   - Validate SVG files for potential script content

## Security Testing

The following security tests are implemented:

1. **Automated Security Checks**
   - `npm run security:check`: Verify packages and run npm audit
   - `npm run security:full-audit`: Comprehensive security audit
   - `npm run security:pentest`: Basic penetration testing

2. **Manual Security Testing**
   - Regular code reviews with security focus
   - Periodic penetration testing
   - Security-focused user acceptance testing

## Security Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. Identify and isolate the affected components
2. Assess the impact and severity
3. Fix the vulnerability
4. Update affected users if necessary
5. Document the incident and update security measures

## Security Updates

Security measures are regularly updated to address new threats and vulnerabilities. The security hardening process includes:

1. Regular dependency updates
2. Security patch application
3. Security audit reviews
4. Penetration testing
5. Security documentation updates
